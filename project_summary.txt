DOCUMIND AI - PROJECT SUMMARY
================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
DocuMind AI is an intelligent document analysis system that combines FastAPI backend with Streamlit frontend to provide AI-powered document processing capabilities. The system allows users to upload PDF and TXT documents, generate customizable summaries, ask contextual questions, and create interactive learning challenges.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
Backend (FastAPI):
- ai_assistant.py: Core AI integration using Groq API for text generation
- document_processor.py: PDF/TXT processing with PyPDF2 and text extraction
- main.py: FastAPI server with RESTful endpoints for document operations

Frontend (Streamlit):
- app.py: Modern web interface with responsive design and professional styling
- Features glassmorphism effects, gradients, and smooth animations
- Responsive layout with wide container (1400px max-width)

API ENDPOINTS
-------------
POST /upload-document: Upload and process documents with customizable summary length
POST /ask-question: Generate contextual answers based on document content
GET /generate-challenges/{doc_id}: Create learning questions from document
POST /evaluate-challenge: Evaluate user answers with AI feedback
DELETE /documents/{doc_id}: Remove documents from system
